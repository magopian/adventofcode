To run the code:
- install [lein](http://leiningen.org/)
- run a repl: `lein repl`
- load the file you're interested in: `(load "aoc/day1")`
- run the function for the part you're interested in: `(aoc.day1/part1)` or
  `(aoc.day1/part2)`

Some of those take quite some time to run. Check the comments in the files.
